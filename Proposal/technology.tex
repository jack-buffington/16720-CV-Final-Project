\section{Technology}

The authors of \cite{newcombe2010live} produced their experimental data utilizing a camera recording at 640x480 resolution at 30Hz. The processing was performed in real-time on a desktop system utilizing a pair of discrete GPU's. This paper was originally published in 2010 and desktop computing performance has increased substantially since then. Ideally, a modern implementation could be performed in real-time on a single desktop GPU, with either resolution increased to 1280x720, or framerate increased to 60Hz. Video will be recorded utilizing a webcam connected to the processing computer to avoid bandwidth limitations that stem from telemetering of video data. \\


Algorithm development and implementation will be performed in MatLab, and supplemented by the accompanying computer vision toolbox only as necessary to maintain the appropriate scope of the project.
